"""
You learned sequence structure, statements executed in order, then selection statements with if statements,
then looping statements. In some languages, there is a case selection statements, sometimes called switch/case.

In Python, you can write your own case statement using a function and a dictionary.

In this assignment you implement a switch/case with a dictionary.

In Module8 project

Create a file assign_average.py with the unimplemented switch_average() function.
Create a file test_assign_average.py
Write a function to test A (and a) return value
Write functions for the other 4 keys
Write function to test if a non-key is passed
What do you expect to happen? Should an exception be raised in the switch? How should you handle the case of no key found?
Run the tests and see them fail, commit to github
Begin the implementation of your switch
Make one test function pass for key value of 'A', then commit to github
Make the next test function (key of 'B') pass for the next value, then commit to github
Repeat above step for each test until all are passing.
